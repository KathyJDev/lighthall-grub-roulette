# Grub-Roulette

A web application that helps two people decide on where to eat by randomly selecting a restaurant based on their preferences.

One player sets up the location and price range of the restaurants they want to see, and then accepts or denies restaurant options until they have narrowed down the choices. Afterward, they are placed on a waiting screen where they can share the game link with the other player.

Once the second player accepts the game link, they will be presented with the same restaurant options and can also accept or deny them. The application will then decide which restaurant to eat at based on the selections of both players.

This project was made as a submission in the Lighthall Software Engineering Super League 1: Level 4.
